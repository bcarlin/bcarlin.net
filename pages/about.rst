I'm currently dveloping two startups: *Continuous Labs* (I will tell some more
about it later as it is not operating publicly for now), and `Waarp`_ a
company spacialized in open source Managed File Transfer solutions.

I was previousy employed as a **software and system architect** at `Maarch`_ where I
mainly design and  **distributed high availability** systems to support
`Maarch applications`_ (3-tier applications deployed on at least 6 nodes).

As for my background, I have a double training.

The first one is a classical **French business school** curiculum, where I received
a training in general management, business stategy and acquired the finance and
accounting 101. I majored in consumer goods marketing and specialized in
**high-tech marketing**. I graduated from `Skema Business School`_ in 2007.

As for the second one, I am a **self-trained engineer** keen on working on web
development. My first steps go back to the time when I was 12yo, when I
discovered HTML in an issue of .NET magazine. A year later, I was developing
a web application in PHP3 to store and easily find recipes (for my mother).
Since then, my daily tools include **Python**, **Go**, and a Sublime Text open
on some web app.

This long-running passion has now become my day-job!

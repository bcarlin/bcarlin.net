I'm several things. Some say there are several people in my head. Anyway.
I am

A human
   There are stuff, technical or not, that bother me. Im might talk
   about it here, or not.

   It also means that I won't always be very active here. Sometimes
   because  I don't want to. Other times because I have other things
   to do.

An entrepreneur
   I was bored in my jobs. Then I realized that was because doing all
   the same stuff over and other was not for me. I really hated copying
   and pasting reports  changing only the customer name.

   What I want is beeing able to explore what I wanted to explore. No
   questions asked. Not having to justify it to a hierarchy.

   I co-founded Doclabs_ and Waarp_, now working full-time
   on the latter.

A techie
   Though I wasn't destined to it (I graduated from a classic
   `Business School`_), my passion has always be code. In all its form.
   Now it's also my work life!

Welcome to my world !

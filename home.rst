hi!

I am passionate about web development and all the technologies it relies on, 
from python and ruby to nodejs, message queueing and NoSQL databases.

I fell in web development more than 10 years ago, at the age of 15, when I was 
a member of the communities of PhpNuke_ and Spip_.

I am currently employed as a software architect by Maarch_, the editor of open source
electronic record management.

Here, you will find some of my rants, some of the thing I discover, some news
about side-projects, and mainly some of the things I do not want to forget.
